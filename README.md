# Sorting Algorithms Visualization

This project is a visualization tool for various sorting algorithms implemented in JavaScript. It provides a visual representation of how different sorting algorithms work and allows users to observe their performance in real-time. 

You can see this software in action on [YouTube]().

## Features

- Visualizes various sorting algorithms in real-time.
- Allows users to observe the efficiency and performance of each algorithm.
- Supports a wide range of sorting algorithms for comparison.
- Customizable array size for experimentation.
- Provides insights into time and space complexity of each algorithm.

## Usage

To use the visualization tool, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. This will launch the visualization interface where you can interact with different sorting algorithms.

## Supported Algorithms

The following sorting algorithms are supported in this visualization tool:

- Bubble Sort
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Heap Sort
- Count Sort
- Bucket Sort
- Comb Sort
- Shell Sort
- Gnome Sort
- Cocktail Shaker Sort
- Tim Sort
- Odd Even Sort
